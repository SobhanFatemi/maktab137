        [Verse 1]
        I've been tryna call
        I've been on my own for long enough
        Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
        I'm goin' through withdrawals
        You don't even have to do too much
        You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

        I look around and
        Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
        No one's around to judge me (Oh)
        I can't see clearly when you're gone

        [Chorus]
        I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
        No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
        I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
        Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
